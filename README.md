# Forecasting-System

First, you can clone my program from GitHub.
Then, you must install all important python moduls such as pandas, pytorch, torchvision, PIL Image and dash by plotly.
With Dash framework, the program will initialize the code, then provides a temporary server which will load the code and the local IP-address to open the local server in a browser.
Copy the IP-address, which shows up in compiler after running the code. Then open your browser and paste the copied IP-address. After that, the UI will show up.
Now you can start to use our program by uploading the rice photo.
